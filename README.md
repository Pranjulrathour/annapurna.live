## üìù Problem Statement

Every day, millions of people go hungry while tons of good food is wasted. In India alone, approximately 40% of the food produced is wasted, while 189.2 million people remain undernourished. This paradox exists because of inefficient food distribution systems and a lack of technology to connect food donors with recipients.

Annapurna Nutrition aims to solve this problem by creating a digital bridge between those with surplus food and those who need it most, using technology to reduce food waste and fight hunger simultaneously.

## üöÄ Approach & Solution

The Annapurna Nutrition platform takes a multi-faceted approach to addressing food waste and hunger:

1. **User-Centric Platform**: We've created an intuitive, visually appealing platform that makes food sharing simple for donors, NGOs, and volunteers.

2. **Community Connectivity**: The platform connects individual donors, restaurants, and event organizers with nearby NGOs and volunteers for efficient food redistribution.

3. **Real-Time Coordination**: Through our platform, donors can quickly post available food, and recipients/volunteers can respond in real-time, ensuring food is transferred while still fresh.

4. **Impact Tracking**: Users can see the direct impact of their donations, encouraging continued participation.

5. **Scalable Infrastructure**: Built with modern web technologies, the platform is designed to scale from local communities to nationwide coverage.
